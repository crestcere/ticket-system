        Comment 1: “This issue is affecting many users and preventing them from accessing the application. We need to prioritize this and find the root cause as soon as possible.”
        Comment 2: “We have tried to reproduce this issue on different browsers and devices, but we could not replicate the problem. It seems that it is related to some network or DNS issues that are beyond our control.”
        Comment 3: “We have implemented some DNS monitoring safeguards to identify what’s causing this issue and alert us when it happens. We are also working on adding a timeout feature to the login page, so that users can retry or refresh the page if it gets stuck on loading.”
    Database connection error:
        Comment 1: “This issue is causing the application to crash and throw an exception whenever it tries to access the database. We need to investigate the database configuration and connection settings and make sure they are correct and secure.”
        Comment 2: “We have found that the database connection error is due to an outdated driver that is incompatible with the latest version of the database. We have updated the driver and tested the connection successfully.”
        Comment 3: “We have deployed the updated driver to the production environment and verified that the database connection error is resolved. We have also added some error handling and logging mechanisms to the application, so that we can catch and report any future database issues.”
    Broken link on homepage:
        Comment 1: “This issue is affecting the user experience and navigation of the application. We need to fix the broken link and make sure that all the links on the homepage are working properly.”
        Comment 2: “We have found that the broken link is due to a typo in the URL of the contact page. We have corrected the typo and tested the link successfully.”
        Comment 3: “We have deployed the corrected URL to the production environment and verified that the broken link is fixed. We have also added some link validation and testing tools to the development process, so that we can prevent and detect any broken links in the future.”
    Incorrect calculation of tax:
        Comment 1: “This issue is affecting the accuracy and reliability of the application. We need to fix the incorrect calculation of tax and make sure that the application is compliant with the tax regulations and rules of the target market.”
        Comment 2: “We have found that the incorrect calculation of tax is due to a bug in the tax calculation formula that is used by the application. We have fixed the bug and tested the calculation successfully.”
        Comment 3: “We have deployed the fixed formula to the production environment and verified that the incorrect calculation of tax is resolved. We have also added some unit testing and verification tools to the development process, so that we can ensure the correctness and quality of the tax calculation logic.”
    Missing images on product page:
        Comment 1: “This issue is affecting the appearance and attractiveness of the application. We need to fix the missing images and make sure that the product page displays the images of the product correctly and clearly.”

        Comment 3: “We have deployed the corrected path to the production environment and verified that the missing images are fixed. However, we have received some feedback from the users that the images are still not showing up on some devices. We need to reopen this issue and investigate further.”
    Slow performance on mobile devices:
        Comment 1: “This issue is affecting the usability and accessibility of the application. We need to improve the performance and optimize the application for mobile devices and different screen sizes.”
        Comment 2: “We have analyzed the performance of the application on mobile devices and identified some factors that are causing the slowness. These include large images, unnecessary scripts, complex animations, and inefficient code. We have started to work on optimizing these factors and reducing the loading time of the pages.”
        Comment 3: “We have implemented some optimization techniques and best practices to the application, such as compressing images, minifying scripts, simplifying animations, and refactoring code. We have also added some caching and prefetching mechanisms to the application, so that it can load the pages faster and smoother.”
